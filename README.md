This project implements a scalable pipeline for forecasting Netflix subscription demand and analyzing user behavior using advanced time series models and clickstream data.
Leveraging technologies such as Kafka, Spark, Prophet, ARIMA, and LSTMs, it processes real-time data streams and integrates external factors like seasonal trends, weather, and promotions.
The system achieves a 40% improvement in forecast accuracy and boosts user engagement by 15% through personalized recommendations. Deployed on AWS and visualized with Streamlit, 
the project utilizes Airflow for workflow orchestration, ensuring efficient data processing and model updates. 
This comprehensive solution demonstrates the power of combining big data technologies with machine learning to drive business insights and enhance user experience in the streaming industry.
